<h2>The Basics of the web</h2>
<p><em>HTML</em>, or hypertext markup language is the basic document type of the itnernet.
  When a computer browser requests a web page, a HTTP request is sent to a server, which typically fulfills said request by providing the corresponding HTML file, which is then in turn interpreted and displayed by a browser.

<h2>HTML introduction</h2>
<p>
  So far in class we've discussed how HTML can be used to display text, images and links.
  Basic HTML is a good introduction to computing because it allows for an easy comparison between input and output, e.g. the difference between the markup language used and the interpreted result from the browser.
  It is commonly said that "computers are stupid," but I prefer to think of them as being hopelessly literal- only the most explicit well-formed instructions are going to have the desired effect.

<h2>HTML elements and tags</h2>

<p>
  The basic unit of HTML markup is called an <b>element</b>, which can represent a simple line break tag &ltbr&gt, or a link to a site with a specific title: &lta href="url"&gt"title"&lta/&gt. In this case, the tag is the content within the brackets, "url" is a <b>value</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Some elements are <b>inline</b>, and effect the text in just a specific place, while others are <b>block</b> elements, which can be said to form an invisible box around their content for manipulatio.
  A line break is an example of the former, while a paragraph element is an example of the latter.
